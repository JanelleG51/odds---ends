# Odds & Ends

At Odds & Ends we never like to see a good bottle of wine being neglected, so it is our mission to gather all of the odd bottles and bin ends that vineyards have lying around and pass them on to our customers by the case for a great price. The offering is simple, pick a case at one of our three price points and you will receive a selection of 12 bottles from the stock you can see on our site. The more you pay for the case, the more expensive the overall value and your case is always guaranteed to be worth at least 50% more than youâ€™ve paid! You can buy once or as many times as you like to take the opportunity to sample wines from all over the world that you may not get anywhere else for a bargain price.

## Design

## Impression 

The site is one of basic presentation meant to give the feel of a handwritten specials board that can be updated daily. The site offers quality wines at a discounted price and as such the stock can change depending on what is available. The impression of basic and changable but quality is what the developer wanted the site to deliver. 

## Typography

To acheive the handwritten specials board feel, the font [Permanent Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker?query=perm) was chosen for the logo and headings. 

The body of the site use [Concert One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Concert+One?query=concert). The curved edges of the lettering wth no sharp edges complements the Permanent Marker font and is in keeping with the overall theme.

## Colour Scheme 
The colours chosen for the site are based on the colours of the wines, white, red, pink hues and green to reflect the colour of some wine bottles. The core text colour is black:

![Coolors Pallete](readme_docs/colour_pallete.png)
## Imagery

Imagery for this site is very much focussed on wine and vineyards with the majority of images being of the wines on offer. The theme is based around wine glasses, grapes, bottles and people enjoying wine demostrated on the [Home](https://odds-and-ends.herokuapp.com/) page and the [Cases](https://odds-and-ends.herokuapp.com/wines/cases/) page.

* Errors
    * Accessing admin only functions 

* Warnings

* Information 
    * Revisiting previous orders 
    * What wine or case is being edited

## CRUD Functionality 
Admin users have full CRUD capability directly from the frontend of the site accessed using their admin login.

From the account dropdown menu, admin user's can:
- Add (Create) cases and wines using the **Product Management** form. They are added directly to the database and show immediately on the sites frontend

From **All Wines** and **All Cases** admin user's can:

- Edit(Update) cases and wines from the **All Wines** and **All Cases** pages by accessing the edit link. The item information appears on the form and all edits are sent to the database and updated immediately on the frontend.
- Delete cases and wines by accessing the **Wine Details** and **Case Details** pages. On clicking the delete button, as part of defensive design, a confirmation modal appears allowing the action to either be cancelled or confirmed. Once confirmed, the item is deleted from the database and all changes are reflected immediately on the frontend 

## Defensive Design

Defensive design measures have been put in place for the following:

Measure | Result
----    | ------
Delete Confirmation | Admin user's cannot delete an item without first confirming the action
Form Validation | All information in forms must meet the set criteria in terms of number of characters, email confirmation and password confirmation. Any fields that do not meet the criteria will prevent form submission and the error will be made clear to the user
Login authentication | The @login_required decorator has been used to secure pages from those without the correct authentication. This prevents unauthenticated users accessing site content using forced URL paths and provides notifcation of prevention and redirection to the appropriate page
Custom Error Page | 404 (***Page Does Not Exist***) and 500 (***Interal Server Error***) pages appear to inform user's of either error and allows them to navigate back to the site without using the back button
Case Quantity | Users are limited to adding 10 of each case and cannot add a quantity of zero 



## Features left to implement 

- Allow user's the ability to leave reviews for cases
- Add subscription service to allow user's to sign up for deliveries at set intervals
- Provide a newsletter subscription 
- Have a facility for wineries to carry out online wine tasting sessions
- Add full set of FAQs

2. Select your desired repository from the options to the left.
3. From the options available at the top right of the screen, which include Watch, Star and Fork, select Fork.
4. A forked branch of the repository is then created. This is a copy of the repository up to the point the forked branch was created.

6. Both repositories can be merged by selecting New Pull Request from the original repository.

## Cloning
1. Log into GitHub.
2. Select your desired repository from the options to the left.
3. From the options available just above the commit list, which include Go to File, Add File, Code and Gitpod, select Code.

## Credits

### Content

The developer took the wine dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/budnyak/wine-rating-and-price), which provided all of the wine information content on this site but not the images.

The matching individual wine images for this site were taken from [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com/GB/en) and the developer stresses that these images are being used for **education and assessment purposes only**

All other images (6) used on the site were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/wine) 
 
### Code

The developer gives credit to the Boutique Ado walkthrough project hosted by the Code Institute and presented by Chris Zielinski - this site was adapted to requirement.

The developer also referred to the [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/) several times throughout the process to understand static files, deployment and modelling. 

### Acknowledgements
The developer would like to thank and acknowledge all the help and support that has been given by so many people so freely over the past year. In particluar, my mentor Victor Miclovich, the Slack community and the wonderful Whatsapp group of other students that I'm a part of who have been amazing just when it was needed.
